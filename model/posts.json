A combination of [Node-RED] and [node.js] modules are used to implement the site. Web pages and [RESTful] interface are implemented using [Node-RED] flows.\r\n\r\nThe focus has been to create a software framework to implement HTML and REST access to single-board [Internet of Things (IoT)] hardware.\r\n\r\n----\r\n###### [\"Would You Like to Know More?\"]\r\n<ul class=\"nav know-more\">\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\"><a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"site-installation\">Installation</a></li>\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\"><a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"site-usage\">Usage</a></li>\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\"><a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"what-is-node-red\">What is Node-RED?</a></li>\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\"><a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"single-board-systems-compatibility\">Single-board systems compatibility</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis site is made up of only two javascript code files (excluding custom [Node-RED nodes]). `./server.js` is the entry point of the application and `./model/database.js` provides permanent data storage.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that developers have an intermediate understanding of [HTML],  [Node.js], [expressjs], [Markdown], and [Node-RED]. The web based [Ace] editor is used to create and edit the site page/post entries, while [Showdown] is used to convert [Markdown] text to [HTML]. The web pages use [BootStrap] V4 in an attempt to be [mobile friendly]. Minimal knowledge of [Ace], [BootStrap], and [Showdown] is sufficient.\r\n - Embed [Node-RED] into an [expressjs] server application.\r\n - Creation and debugging of application specific [Node-RED nodes].\r\n - Operation on single board systems (low cpu/memory footprint)\r\n   - [Raspberry Pi], [BeagleBoard], [Intel Edison], etc.\r\n\r\n----\r\n###### [\"Would You Like to Know More?\"]\r\n<ul class=\"nav know-more\">\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\"><a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"embed-node-red\">Embed Node-RED into Expressjs server</a></li>\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\"><a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"app-specific-node-red-nodes\">Application specific Node-RED nodes</a></li>\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\"><a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"single-board-systems-compatibility\">Single-board systems compatibility</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe [MVC] paradigm is used as a framework. A JSON file stores data, keeping inline with the minimalist concept of [Node-RED]. [Node-RED] accesses the `model and business logic` (database) via four javascript procedures `newPost`, `getPosts`, `updatePost`, and `deletePost` which are analogous to the [CRUD] operations in a [RESTful] interface. [Business] logic is implemented with-in the `model` component as suggested by the [MVC] paradigm.\r\n\r\nFor larger machines, one could implement the four javascript procedures to access _for example_ [MySQL], [Oracle], or [MongoDB]; which would work without any changes to the [Node-RED] flows as long as the resulting data content, format, and order are identical.\r\n - Interface [Node-RED] to [MVC] model and business logic components written as conventional [node.js] modules.\r\n\r\n----\r\n###### [\"Would You Like to Know More?\"]\r\n<ul class=\"nav know-more\">\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\"><a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"mvc-logic\">MVC model and business logic</a></li>\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\"><a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"#\">Common Node.js Database Modules</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe MVC [controller and view] components are implemented using [Node-RED] flows. The `controller` part is straight forward by using [Node-RED] `Http in and out` nodes. Web page `views` are constructed using the [Node-RED] built-in [mustache template engine] `template node`. Mustache is logic-less, which basically means there is only a most basic method to implement if-then-else conditionals with-in the template. Because of this, [Presentation] Logic is implemented as a Node-RED [sub-flow] to be shared by higher level flows.\r\n - Implement [MVC] control, view, and [presentation] logic components using [node-red] flows.\r\n - Using [node-red] sub-flows for presentation of web page styles, header, footer, navigation, and client-side scripts .\r\n\r\n----\r\n###### [\"Would You Like to Know More?\"]\r\n<ul class=\"nav know-more\">\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\"><a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"node-red-subflows\">Node-RED subflows</a></li>\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\"><a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"control-view-and-presentation-logic\">MVC control, view, and presentation logic</a></li>\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\"><a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"#\">Building presentation logic in Node-RED</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n----\r\n###### [\"Would You Like to Know More?\"]\r\n<ul class=\"nav know-more\">\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\"><a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"site-web-page-flows\">Site Web Page Flows</a></li>\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\"><a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"site-restful-flows\">Site RESTful flows</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n > **Note:** This project is an instructive tool installing itself locally at `http://localhost:8081`. **Anybody** with access to the site can modify blog pages and posts. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Discuss**:\r\n - Situations when a conventional nodejs module is appropriate versus a node-red node\r\n - Scenarios when usage of node-red sub-flows is advantageous\r\n\r\n**IMHO**:\r\n - Where is the **'Logic'** in [MVC]???\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nTo see if you are interested, or wish to only see blog pages and posts:\r\n```bat\r\nnpm install node-red-from-the-bottom\r\ncd node-red-from-the-bottom\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\nThen in address bar of your web browser:\r\n```\r\nhttp://localhost:8081\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever; `node-red-from-the-bottom` is designed to be cloned so that you can inspect, modify, and play around with it.\r\n```bat\r\ngit clone https://github.com/PotOfCoffee2Go/node-red-from-the-bottom.git\r\ncd node-red-from-the-bottom\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\n[\"Would You Like to Know More?\"]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdrjzE1SE58\r\n[Node-Red]: https://nodered.org/\r\n[process and data flow]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming\r\n[control and view]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\r\n[controller and view]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\r\n[Model]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\r\n[MVC]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\r\n[HTML]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML\r\n[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/\r\n[Business]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic\r\n[expressjs]: https://expressjs.com/\r\n[Presentation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_logic\r\n[Node-RED nodes]: https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/\r\n[Internet of Things (IoT)]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things\r\n[Raspberry Pi]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi\r\n[BeagleBoard]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeagleBoard\r\n[Intel Edison]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Edison\r\n[core nodes]: https://github.com/node-red/node-red/tree/master/nodes/core\r\n[CRUD]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete\r\n[RESTful]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer\r\n[mustache template engine]: https://mustache.github.io/\r\n[MySQL]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL\r\n[Oracle]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database\r\n[MongoDB]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB\r\n[Markdown]: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\r\n[Showdown]: https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki\r\n[Ace]: https://ace.c9.io/\r\n[nodes]: https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/\r\n[RESTful]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer\r\n[BootStrap]: http://getbootstrap.com/\r\n[mobile friendly]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Web\r\n",

It has a small cpu/memory footprint allowing operation on single board devices such as [Raspberry Pi], [BeagleBoard], [Intel Edison], etc. One of the objectives is to use only the [core nodes] provided by the standard [Node-RED] install along with implementation of site specific [nodes].\r\n - Embed [Node-RED] into an express site\r\n - Programmatically set [Node-RED] configuration parameters\r\n - Use [Node-RED] to implement process flows initiated by HTTP requests\r\n - Deliver HTML and/or RESTful content using [Node-RED] flows\r\n - Delivery of static content (css, js, images, etc.) along side [Node-RED] flows\r\n - How to interface [Node-RED] `function` nodes to nodejs `modules`\r\n - Creation and debugging of application specific [Node-RED nodes]\r\n - Sharing of [Node-RED] code via sub-flows\r\n\r\n----\r\n###### [\"Would You Like to Know More?\"]\r\n<ul class=\"nav know-more\">\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\">\r\n    <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"/posts/site-usage\">Blog Site Usage</a>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\">\r\n    <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"/posts/what-is-node-red\">What is Node-RED?</a>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\">\r\n    <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"/red\">Web Page Flows</a>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\">\r\n    <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"/red/#flow/8c3ec654.d10248\">RESTful flows</a>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n----\r\n\r\n----\r\n###### [\"Would You Like to Know More?\"]\r\n<ul class=\"nav know-more\">\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\">\r\n    <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"/posts/site-usage\">Site Usage</a>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\">\r\n    <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"/red/#flow/3082454d.fb9b3a\">HTML page Flows</a>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li class=\"nav-item\">\r\n    <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"/red/#flow/8c3ec654.d10248\">REST request Flows</a>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n----\r\n\r\nProcess [flows] are implemented via a graphical browser-based flow editor (`Node-RED Editor`) used to describe sequences of [data flow] movement (`msg`) between one or more _independent_ synchronous and/or asynchronous processes (`nodes`). Flows modified in the `Node-RED Editor` are immediately implemented by _deploying_ flow changes to the [Node-RED] runtime.\r\n\r\nThe transmission of data consists of `wires` between one or more in/out `ports` assigned to each `node`. The wires determine the <span style=\"color:blue;\">path</span> of the `msg` data object which is the primary interaction between `nodes`. Node-RED also provides global contexts allowing nodes to share common data and functions. \r\n\r\nA `flow` is a sequence of `nodes` that are wired together. Since multiple `wires` can be connected to a single in/out `port`, a `flow` can have multiple  <span style=\"color:blue;\">paths</span> which node-red executes concurrently. The data `msg` content is cloned for each <span style=\"color:blue;\">path</span> thus the content of `msg` from one `path` can diverge from the `msg` content of another <span style=\"color:blue;\">path</span>.\r\n\r\n[Node-RED] can run as a standalone application or can be embedded as a module of a node.js application.\r\n\r\n[\"Would You Like to Know More?\"]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdrjzE1SE58\r\n[Node-RED]: https://nodered.org/\r\n[flow based]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming\r\n[flows]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming\r\n[GitHub]: https://github.com/node-red\r\n[IBM Emerging Technology Group]: https://emerging-technology.co.uk/\r\n[JS Foundation]: https://js.foundation/community/projects\r\n[data flow]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming\r\n[Node-RED nodes]: https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/\r\n[Internet of Things (IoT)]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things\r\n[Raspberry Pi]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi\r\n[BeagleBoard]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeagleBoard\r\n[Intel Edison]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Edison\r\n[core nodes]: https://github.com/node-red/node-red/tree/master/nodes/core\r\n[nodes]: https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/\r\n",

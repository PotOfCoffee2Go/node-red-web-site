Flows modified in the `Node-RED Editor` are immediately implemented by _deploying_ flow changes to the [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) runtime.\r\n\r\n - The transmission of data consists of `wires` between one or more in/out `ports` assigned to each `node`. The wires determine the <span style=\"color:blue;\">path</span> of the `msg` data object which is the primary interaction between `nodes`. Node-RED also provides global contexts allowing nodes to share common data and functions. \r\n\r\n - A `flow` is a sequence of `nodes` that are wired together. Since multiple `wires` can be connected to a single in/out `port`, a `flow` can have multiple  <span style=\"color:blue;\">paths</span> which node-red executes concurrently. The data `msg` content is cloned for each <span style=\"color:blue;\">path</span> thus the content of `msg` from one `path` can diverge from the `msg` content of another <span style=\"color:blue;\">path</span>.\r\n\r\n - [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) can run as a standalone application or can be embedded as a module of a node.js application.\r\n \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nTo see if you are interested, or wish to only see blog pages and posts:\r\n```bat\r\nnpm install node-red-from-the-bottom\r\ncd node-red-from-the-bottom\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\nThen in address bar of your web browser:\r\n```\r\nhttp://localhost:8081\r\n```\r\n<br><br>\r\nHowever; `node-red-from-the-bottom` is designed to be cloned so that you can inspect, modify, and play around with it.\r\n```bat\r\ngit clone https://github.com/PotOfCoffee2Go/node-red-from-the-bottom.git\r\ncd node-red-from-the-bottom\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\n### Not as difficult as you might think\r\nThis blog site is made up of only three javascript code files (excluding custom [Node-RED nodes](https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/)).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\n",
